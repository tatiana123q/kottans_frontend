# TASK 0
I already have some experience with githut, but it was only about pushing of some code or cloning repository. This information was really useful, especially try.github.io
# TASK 1
As for me, there was a lot of information in this course. Only the basic linux commands were familiar to me before, such us commands cat, cd, mkdir, mv, copy ect. I have read about network protokols, for instanse HTTP, TCP, IP. I have figured out what is DNS, ip adresses, and how traffic moves on the Internet, and private network. Also I have discovered information about linux file system, and important directories.

# TASK 2
Almoust all commands was in the task0, but here the information was considered in more detail.
